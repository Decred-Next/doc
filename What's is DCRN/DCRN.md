# DCRN

## What's Decred-Next
Decred-Next is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred-Next without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a decred (DCRN).



## How does it work
Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain’s consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project’s treasury is used to fund it. Decred-Next’s blockchain is similar to Bitcoin’s, but with major aspects of governance baked into the protocol.

To align incentives, block rewards are split between Proof-of-Work (PoW) miners, stakeholders and the Decred Treasury, which funds the project.
|   party  |  reward  |
|:--------:|:--------:|
|PoW Miners|60%|
|PoS Voters|30%|
|Decred Treasury|10%|

**Proof of Work** miners play a similar role for Decred-Next as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 60% of the block reward.

**Proof of Stake** voting is central to Decred-Next’s governance. Decred-Next holders can time-lock (or “stake”) DCRN to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain; this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open rule change proposals. 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into the **Decred-Next Treasury**. Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through Politeia proposals and voting.

The **Decred-Next Constitution** sets out some guiding principles for the project; the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.



## Wallets
Decredniton is Decred-Next’s GUI wallet for Windows, MacOS and Linux. It supports voting through Voting Service Providers and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in governance.

There is also a Command Line Interface (CLI) for Windows, MacOS and Linux. The CLI exposes more advanced functionality, including the ability to run a personal voting wallet.

Mobile wallets for Android and iOS are also available. To minimize data plan, processing power and storage requirements, the mobile wallets make use of SPV mode.
