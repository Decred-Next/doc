# Airdrop
DCRN is a fork of DCR and airdrops to users

# Airdrop rules:
At the block height of 660550, the project took a snapshot of the active users (there is a transactionï¼Œ including the vast majority of users) holding a DCR of 0.1 or more, and carried out an airdrop.
Each month (8640 blocks apart) is divided into 512 blocks for 280,000 airdrops, with a total of 50 airdrops.
Among them, 14,000 are directly sent to the user, and the user can use the original DCR wallet mnemonic to receive it. 266,000 project parties plan to burn them monthly.
